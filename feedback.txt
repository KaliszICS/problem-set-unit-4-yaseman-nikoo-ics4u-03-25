equals should convert to Card AFTER you check that it is a card and not null.
No if statement required for final comparison, just return the condition
Using an arraylist on our backend would simplify your code a lot.
reshuffle should use addCard and/or shuffle so you don't need to write their code again.
player draw should not add the card they draw if it is null (deck is empty)
